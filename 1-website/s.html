                        inspiration and Hindavi Swaraj visionary</h2>
                        <p>Jijabai was Shahjiraje’s wife and Chatrapati Shivaji 
                            Maharaj’s mother, she was the queen and Rajmata too. 
                            She moulded him into an ideal ruler by sowing seeds of 
                            devotion to the nation and Dharma. She was not only a 
                            mother to Shivaji, but also a source of inspiration. 
                            She had a strong faith that she was blessed by Goddess
                             Bhavani and Mahadev. She strongly believed that our 
                             efforts bring success to our doorstep only with the 
                             grace of God.</p>
